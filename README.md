# ✏️ MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier

This project is based on *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow* by **Aurélien Géron**.  
It implements traditional **machine learning algorithms** (like `SGDClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`, etc.) for recognizing handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** — one of the most iconic datasets in data science.
